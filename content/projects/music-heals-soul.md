**Project Description**
Music Heals the Soul is a Smart Application that recommends songs from Spotify of a particular genre based on the real time emotions of the user.

**What problems does it solve?**
We often find it hard to discuss our feelings with others. And so we find solace in music.
Music is often underestimated for its ability make us feel better.
In this project, we have created a live emotion detection algorithm that can predict the emotions of the person in real time and recommend songs to cheer them up!

**Inspiration**
The coronavirus pandemic has taken a serious toll on our mental health. And one of the few things that makes us feel good is music.It's something that disconnects us from the grim reality. Music has kept most of us sane during these testing times. One of the greatest qualities of music is the range of emotion in the songs. Each song has been written by the songwriters, who pen their emotions into beautiful songs, and this application hopes to help people relax and listen to songs based on their emotion and mental state at that time.

**Tech Stack :** 
* Data Preprocessing - Numpy and Pandas
* Data Cleaning - Neattext
* Song Recommendation - Spotify API
* Model Building - sklearn pipelines, Logistic Regression, Count Vectorizers
* FrontEnd - HTML,CSS and Streamlit
