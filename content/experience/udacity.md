## Description

As part of the Udacity Bertelsmann Scholarship that I received in December 2020, I got access to an amazing community that had the sole goal of improving their skills and awareness in the Data Analytics and Predictive Analytics Domain. 

We also had Student Leaders for the Study Groups that were formed to blend in with people from all over the world and I was fortunate to head the sg_south_east_asia group that comprised of people from predominantly South East Asian Countries. Some of my core responsibilities were:

- To encourage the community to complete the challenge course required to proceed to the Challenge Course.
- To schedule meetings and sessions on topics related to the current course and increase interactivity amongst the study group members.
