### Description

- This was a very unique role to me since teaching is a skill I was not familiar with. 
- I scripted and shot high quality video tutorials covering a very popular Python Visualization Library, Seaborn.
- In this role, I was responsible for creating easy to understand and vibrant content that used real world datasets for visualization.
- Apart from ensuring that the quality of the videos was high, I also played a role in generating keywords for SEO optimization of the title and description of the tutorial series.
- I was able to start the YouTube channel from scratch and take it to over 2000 subscribers with 4000 views.
- Here is a link to the ðŸ“½ playlist : [Seaborn For Data Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb9AfI-bsXibgECEzyT7Bdw/featured)
