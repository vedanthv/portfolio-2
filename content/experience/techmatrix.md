# Description

- Newolf Society is a inter-university technology focussed club that has over 300 students from universities all over India.
- I worked on two Web Development focussed projects in my tenure at Newolf.

## **Give2Charity** 

Wastage of food in restaurants , homes , parties and marriages is a big problem in the world and this is prevalent to a large extent in India as well. Without our knowledge, lot of food is wasted in our home whereas the population of India below the poverty line do not get even one square meal a day!

Give2Charity bids an effort to bring forth a solution to this problem and reach out to as many poor, malnourished and unemployed inhabitants of India by providing a complete, full fledged and easy to use platform with round the clock support that can be used by anyone in the world to donate money, food, clothes and all other essentials and contribute to the noble cause we are tackling in this project.
